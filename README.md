I have created a  basic WebGIS (Web Geographic Information System) application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Leaflet library.
**HTML Structure:** Sets up the layout and content of the webpage.
**CSS Styling:** Defines styles for various elements to enhance the visual appearance.
**JavaScript Interactivity:** Uses Leaflet to create and control a map with multiple layers, markers, and interactive elements.
